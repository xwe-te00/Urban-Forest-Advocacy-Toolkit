# Environmental Benefits

- **Air Quality Improvement**: Trees absorb pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, improving local air quality.
- **Stormwater Management**: Urban forests reduce runoff by intercepting rainfall, decreasing flood risks and improving water quality.
- **Heat Island Reduction**: Trees provide shade and evapotranspiration, lowering ambient temperatures in urban areas.
